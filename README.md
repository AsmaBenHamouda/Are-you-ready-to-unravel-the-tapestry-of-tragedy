Project Title: Unveiling the Tapestry of Tragedy: A Deep Dive into US Gun Violence (2006-2020)

## I. 🔍 Introduction
Exploring Gun-Related Deaths in the United States (2006-2020)

This project delves into the complexities of gun violence in the United States by analyzing a comprehensive dataset covering the period from 2006 to 2020. We will examine trends, patterns, and contributing factors to better understand this critical public health issue.

## II. 📊 Global Analysis of the Dataframe
This project aims to analyze a dataset covering gun violence in the United States over a 15-year period, from 2006 to 2020. The data is split into multiple CSV files, one per year, named from "guns_2006.csv" to "guns_2020.csv."

Each CSV file contains detailed information about individual gun-related incidents, with one row per incident. The dataset columns include:

year: Year of the incident.
month: Month of the incident.
intent: The intent behind the incident (homicide, suicide, etc.).
police: Indicates if police were involved in the incident.
sex: Gender of the victim.
age: Age of the victim.
race: Ethnic background of the victim.
hispanic: Whether the victim was of Hispanic origin.
place: Location of the incident.
education: Education level of the victim.

# III. ✨ Data Cleaning 
Before diving into the analysis, the dataset underwent significant cleaning, including:

Removing missing values or filling them with appropriate averages.
Standardizing column names and ensuring consistent data types.
Handling outliers and inconsistencies in the data.

# IV. 👀 Data Visualization: General Conclusions
Through data visualizations, we uncover several key insights:

## Distribution of Deaths by Year and Intent:
The number of suicides increases year by year, followed by homicides.
## Distribution of Deaths by Race and Intent:
White individuals have a higher proportion of suicides and homicides compared to Black individuals.
## Distribution of Deaths by Age and Intent:
Younger individuals have a higher proportion of suicides and homicides. Accidental deaths are more common among the young and the elderly.
## Distribution of Deaths by Gender and Intent:
Men are more likely to die from homicides and accidents, while women have a higher proportion of suicides.
Distribution of Deaths by Intent and Police Involvement:
Homicides are more likely to involve police, while suicides are less likely.
## Distribution of Deaths by Education Level and Intent:
Accidental deaths are more common among those with less than a high school education, while suicides are more common among college graduates.
